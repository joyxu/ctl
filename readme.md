# CTL : the C++ Talks List

## What is it

This is a list of talks about C++ or related subjects I compiled 
from the playlists of a number of C++ (and related) conferences.
Suggestions for other conferences to be included are welcome.

I don't pretend to be a front-end developer, so 
beside the simple web page (https://wovo.github.io/ctl/) the list
is available in json and javscript formats, 
with a Python interface for maybe slightly easier use.
If you create you own interface, let me know!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Conferences

Conferences I included so far are:
- accu 2016-2021
- BoostCon 2010-2011
- C++ Day 2020

## Tags

The talks have tags, but these are inferred 
from the conference and talk title.

I used or plan to use these tags:
- conference, meetup
- talk, keynote, lightning, interview, panel
- live, online
- c++, c, java, javscript, python, assembler
- c++11, c++14, c++17, c++20
- standard, evolution
- hardware, embedded, latency, freestanding, unit
- git, make, cmake
- exception, template, concept, constexpr, lambda, volatile, int
- stl, container, algorithm
- procedural, oo, functional
- compilation, jit, emulation, retro
- quality, naming, testing

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Level

There is a field to rate the talk for the experience level of the intended
audience, but this has not been done yet (all are at 0, which means unknown).
The intended levels are:
- 1 : no programming experience
- 2 : no experience any specific the programming language
- 3 : no experience with the subject within the programming language
- 4 : ??
- 5 : junior programmer level
- 6 : ??
- 7 : senior programmer level
- 8 : ??
- 9 : specialist in the subject
- 10 : central committee level
