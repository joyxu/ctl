# what is it

This is a list of talks about C++ and/or related subjects I compiled 
from the playlists and schedules of a number of C++ (and related) conferences.
Suggestions for other conferences to be included are welcome.
I apologize for the (probably many) inaccuracies and omissions.
Feel free to suggest corrections.

I don't pretend to be a front-end developer, so 
beside the simple web page (https://wovo.github.io/ctl/) the list
is available in json and javscript formats, 
with a Python interface for maybe slightly easier use.
If you create you own interface, let me know!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## details

The main source I used was 
https://isocpp.org/wiki/faq/conferences-worldwide
which has links to playlists for most conferences.
I created this list with a combination of Python scripts
and manual corrections. This mostly seems to work now.
In the process, I converted all text to ascii (sorry speakers...).

The conferences I included so fare are:
- accu (spring) 2016-2019 (from the program page)
- accu (autumn) 2019
- c++now 2010-2019, 2021
- code-dive 2014-2020 (from the program page)
- meeting-c++ 2014-2020
- meeting-embedded 2018, 2020
- cppcon 2014-2020
- c++-on-sea 19-20 
- cpp-india 2021
- pacific-c++ 2017, 2018
- Core C++
- CPPP
- cpp europe 

The talks have tags, but this is still rudimentary.
I used or plan to use these tags:
- conference, meetup
- talk, keynote, lightning, interview, panel
- live, online
- c++, c, java, javscript, python, assembler
- c++11, c++14, c++17, c++20
- standard, evolution
- embedded, latency, freestanding, unit
- git, make, cmake
- exception, template, concept, constexpr, lambda, volatile, int
- stl, container, algorithm
- procedural, oo, functional
- compilation, jit
- quality, naming, testing

There is a field to rate the talk for the experience level of the intended
audience, but this has not been done yet (all are at 0, which means unknown).
The intended levels are:
- 1 : no programming experience
- 2 : no experience any specific the programming language
- 3 : no experience with the subject within the programming language
- 4 : ??
- 5 : junior programmer level
- 6 : ??
- 7 : senior programmer level
- 8 : ??
- 9 : specialist in the subject
- 10 : central committee level

- accu again, note the lightning's
- FOSDEM (lots of talks, maybe not so interesting?)
- embo++, Core Hard, C++ Day, ADC++ (no playlists?)
